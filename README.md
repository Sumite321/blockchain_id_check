 International identification using blockchain technology


Problem statement: 

Where is our personal information such as criminal records, residency, driving license info stored? - The governamental database. How can we ensure this data has never been tampered? We canâ€™t. Anyone can be paid to erase/mess with this data.


With the use of blockchain we came up with a decentralised system where the individual is registered into the network. This way every information(block) is encrypted forming a chain. Only the user has access to it and able to re-write. To ensure integrity, everyone has a copy of this chain in such a way that if anyone tries to change the information from the outside, the hash changes, invalidating the whole chain. 


Advantages include able to instantly verify an individuals information without the worry that data may have been changed.
